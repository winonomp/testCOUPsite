                <p id="introDesc">There is a lot of advice out there on how best to structure a pitch deck.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, even the most experienced founders have the tendency to use pitch decks that are a long way off what I, as a VC, would expect to see .
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst there isn’t actually a perfect blueprint, I decided to try and create my own version of the “perfect” pitch deck. The perfect content for a slide deck depends on the stage, segment and character of each individual startup as well as the recipient (each VC has its own preferences).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So this is just <a href="">Iskender Dirik</a>’s suggestion for a pitch deck using “fictional” startup “DoggyHut”— as an example of what I would love to see when being pitched to.</p>
         <div class="pitchDeckImg"><div class="theImg">

                </div>
                <p>By the way, the deck I have  created is meant to be shared via email or as a handout and not a spoken presentation. I explain why towards the end.</p>

                <h2>SOME GENERAL THOUGHTS</h2>
                <p>Most founders struggle to understand the simple logic that: a pitch deck is a <strong>teaser</strong>. Its goal is to whet an investor’s appetite and thus initiate the next stage/step (to get a meeting). What it is not meant to do is provide a deep dive into your company. I mean, do you think a startup has ever been turned down for having too few details in their pitch deck?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The attention span of a VC is shorter than you might think. Be as striking, simple and concise as possible. Laser-focus on the most important aspects of your business.</p>

                            <p>If I had more time, I would have written
                                a shorter letter.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>If your startup is a movie, then the pitch deck isn’t even a trailer. It’s the few short seconds of teaser before the trailer even starts — a <a href="">trailer for a trailer.</a>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before doing anything, crafting the right structure for your deck is vital. My DoggyHut Slidedeck structure-wise has a huge overlap with Sequoia Capital’s advice in <a href="">“Writing a Business Plan”</a>. Check also:</p>

                    <p>I personally,  love to see a simple graphic that sums up your product/business model at the very beginning. Starting with a concrete explanation about the product/solution helps 
                        me to categorize and understand the information on the following slides (see <a href="">The Pyramid Principle — Lessons from McKinsey</a>). Ideally your key visual describes the “What” (what is your product) and the “How” (how does your product work/how do you achieve your mission).

                    <p>Why is your team the best fit for making this startup idea a success? Show that you have the relevant experience, knowledge and skills for this business. If you have experience in working together, make this explicit. If you still need to complement your management team, make this clear.

                        Don’t overload the slides with everything your team has done in their life—this is not a CV. Instead focus on characteristics and experiences that are the most relevant to succeed in your specific area of business.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Depending on the specifics of your startup and stage, you could go with “Roadmap”, “Financials” or “Traction” as the title and content of this section. This can also be divided into two slides. If your startup is (pre) seed stage, you probably won’t have enough financials to present and will instead need to focus on your roadmap and/or your traction (e.g. number of users).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The overall goal of this section is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inform about the most important financial metrics and unit economics.</li>
                        <li>Give a rough overview about the company history and previous (and ideally also following) financing rounds.</li>
                        <li>Show traction/growth and ideally why “now” is a great (inflection) point in the company's history to invest in it. This is also
                             a good place to show your hockey-stick or other striking curves/graphs that visualize your hyper growth. 
                            In the DoggyHut deck, you’ll find two alternative versions of this slide.

                    <p>Actually the vision slide is not the end. You need one more: The Call To Action. It is here that you clearly state what you want from the reader. Clarify the investment sum you wish to raise and what role the reader can play in achieving that (such as leading the round or contributing a specific amount as co-investor). Don’t forget to include contact information.

                    <h3>a) Descriptive Titles</h3>
                    <p>Always use a descriptive slide title that summarizes your slide’s core message. A VC should be able to gather the main pillars 
                        of your pitch story by skimming your deck just reading the titles of each slides (and nothing else). Imagine you’d copy the titles of all 
                        slides together — the end result should look like an executive summary of your pitch deck.</p>

                    <h3>b) Keep Text to Minimum</h3>
                    <p>Reduce the content/text of each slide as much as possible. No VC has the time and attention span to go through an e-book-length deck full of text. 
                        Use large font sizes and be as visual as possible. Never do what I did in my early days when I created fundraising slides like this:</p>
             <div class="pitchDeckImg"><div class="theImg">
                        <img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-03-18 at 02.04.54.png"></div>
                        <p class="jobPosition">Example for far too much text on a slidee</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Horrible.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guide">
                    <h3>c) Slides that tell a story a.k.a. “when it’s okay to have more slides”</h3>
                    <p>There is one exception to my “not more than 12–13 slides” rule. You can have more slides if you use your deck for effective storytelling, e.g using one hero visual with no more than a few words (max 1–2 sentences including the title) per slide. Formatting your additional slides like this will give the reader an engaging experience that reveals one piece of your pitch story after the other.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This approach means that instead of aggregating a couple of points on just one slide, you decouple them and put each point on a separate, easy-to-digest slide.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here is an example. This is the “Why Now” slide from my slide deck:</p>
             <div class="pitchDeckImg"><div class="theImg">
                        <img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-03-18 at 02.06.16.png"></div>
                        <p class="jobPosition">DoggyHut "Why Now?" slide</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>You could easily split this up over a couple of slides:</p>

             <div class="pitchDeckImg"><div class="theImg">
                        <img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-03-18 at 02.07.28.png"></div>
                       
                    </div>
             <div class="pitchDeckImg"><div class="theImg">
                        <img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-03-18 at 02.07.36.png"></div>
                       
                    </div><div class="pitchDeckImg"><div class="theImg">
                        <img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-03-18 at 02.07.46.png"></div>
                        
                    </div>
                    <p>This approach has another big advantage: You can transform your slides much 
                        easier into slides for a spoken live presentation … which brings us to our last topic:</p>

                <div class="guide">
                    <h3>d) Handout vs. Deck for Spoken Live Presentations</h3>
                    <p>Again: The deck I created is meant to be provided via email/as handout. This is not the perfect deck for a spoken presentation and a pitching situation! Don’t do, 
                        what most founders do: Don’t present your printout/handout slides! Your slides for spoken presentations need <strong>much less text — you</strong> present your story, 
                        the slides just <strong>support</strong> the story, but don’t repeat it. Thus use pictures and try to use not more than six words per slide.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is a slide for a handout deck you send to VCs via email:</p>
             <div class="pitchDeckImg"><div class="theImg">
                        <img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-03-18 at 02.10.26.png"></div>
                    </div>
                    <p>However, this would be the version you present during a live presentation:</p>
             <div class="pitchDeckImg"><div class="theImg">
